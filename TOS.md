Welcome to the Dark Skies Cyber League.
A digital mirror to the skies, reflecting the unseen signals of risk and the bright sparks of insight.

As a League of Volunteers under the International Dark Skies, we are dedicated to fostering intersectional dialogue and global collaboration across the cyber and risk domains. Here, observation and reflection converge to map the evolving constellation of threats and opportunities.

We gather under the shared identity of Dark Skies Cyber, League of Volunteers.
This mission, under International Dark Skies, is to promote intersectional dialogue and collaboration across global cyber and risk domains. This is a space where:
Risk may be individual.


Risk may be geopolitical, ex/communicable, shared, censored, or amplified.


Risk to academic researcher safety is recognized as an occupational hazard.


Risk is a tabletop game—and this is an academic research community forum.



Scope
This forum is an open, voluntary space for discussion and exchange. Participation is entirely at the will of each individual—unless circumstances dictate otherwise under applicable law or governance policies.
At this time:
No formal background checks are conducted on participants.


No formal vetting of identities or affiliations is performed.


This means:
Engage wisely.


Assess your personal risk tolerance before sharing sensitive information.


Protect your operational security as you deem necessary.


Repeat after me: “My lane is not your lane. I must use indicators to switch lanes.”
